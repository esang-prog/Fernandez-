      <h1>INFO ABOUT ME</h1>
 <ul>
    <p>I’m Cecille a first year ACT student. All I can say about myself is that I didn't much experience the childhood that other children haved experienced. Being a first born daughter has huge responsibility in their shoulder, taking the rule as a second mother for their younger siblings is so hard. Thats why I have a big respect for all the Ate out there.</p>

        <p>All I can say in ACT program actually being enrolled in ACT program is so hard, why? beacuse its so hard studying the program you dont want to study to , but because I have no choice, I choose ACT program because practicality hit me, because I saw how difficult life was for my family, so I had no choice but to choose the ACT program</p>
